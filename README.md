# CalAppo

This project implements a small calendar application that can be used on Windows, Linux and as an Android app.
It synchronises calendar data with a server you specify (e. g. use a Raspberry Pi at home as base station all devices sync with).


The project is barely started yet, it's not even decided, what utility, framework or language to use for the Android app.
Don't expect anything from this, it's merely a playground for now.


## Current try
Currently using / learning Android Studio with Java to form the app with Material Design.
